# REST-API-using-Spring-boot
A simple CRUD REST API developed using Spring boot
The only changes I made are in 
1. src/main/java/com/demo/example folder - to define the entities and the business logic for API.
2. application.properties file - to establish connection to the database and set the port number.
Rest of the code is all provided by Spring boot.
It reduces the amount of boiler-plate code we need to write by a huge amount.
Any dependencies can be added in pom.xml file manually from mvnrepository incase they are not added at the beginning.
